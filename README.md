Features
Jenkins Integration: Automated build and deployment pipelines.
Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for managing AWS resources.
Docker: Containerization of applications for consistent environments.
AWS: Cloud infrastructure for high availability and scalability.
Architecture
The project follows a modular architecture:

Jenkins Pipeline:

Triggers on code commits.
Executes Terraform scripts for infrastructure setup.
Builds Docker images and pushes them to a container registry.
Deploys Docker containers to AWS services (e.g., ECS, EKS).
Terraform Scripts:

Defines AWS infrastructure (VPCs, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, etc.).
Provisions necessary resources for running Docker containers.
Docker:

Containerizes applications for easy deployment and scaling.
AWS:

Provides the cloud environment for hosting the application.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Jenkins
Terraform
Docker
AWS CLI
An AWS account with appropriate permissions
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Set up Jenkins:

Configure the Jenkins pipeline with the Jenkinsfile provided.
Set up necessary environment variables and credentials in Jenkins.
Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
Build and Deploy Docker Containers:

Jenkins will automatically build and deploy Docker containers based on the pipeline configuration.
Usage
Trigger the Pipeline: Commit code to the repository to trigger the Jenkins pipeline.
Monitor Jenkins Jobs: Check the Jenkins dashboard to monitor the progress of the build and deployment process.
Access Deployed Application: Once deployment is successful, access your application via the provided AWS endpoint.
